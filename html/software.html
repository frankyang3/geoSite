                    The program is a simple Stock Analyzer. It web scrapes
                    for stock info and graphs it in a custom built 
                    tkinter graphing interface. It also has the feature 
                    to use multivariate regression to build a linear,
                    and a polynomial regression model with time as the x-axis
                    and price on the y-axis (The idea is to find trends over time).
                    Additionally, it pulls, from the web, stock fundamentals 
                    (p/e ratio, volume, ROA etc.) so that they can be easily accessed. 
                    Furthermore, it analyzes the price chart and points out major 
                    price fluctuations and uses a stock news API to get correlated news 
                    for that price change. There is also an industry average 
                    analyzer that, given a market cap and industry, it finds all 
                    relevant companies and pulls the average values for each of 
                    their fundamentals. This can then be used to compare individual 
                    stocks within the industry to get a better financial sense of
                    how a company is doing. This practice is commonly used in 
                    accounting for horizontal and trend analysis.
